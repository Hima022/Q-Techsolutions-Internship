PROJECT DESCRIPTION :
The Smart Expense Tracker is an expenses management and analysis tool 
that has been developed using the Python programming language. It enables 
users to enter the expense information, classify them, and analyze their 
spending patterns over a month or a year. This tool also gives good 
graphical representation of the spending behavior and thus helps one to 
make better decisions in terms of finances. Also, there is the application of 
database management in the program in order to capture expenses for 
analysis in the future. 

OBJECTIVE:
The aim of this project is to construct a smart expense tracker application that lets 
users handle their core financial transactions effectively. Thus, the system will 
allow users to: 
1.Add, Edit, and Delete Expenses: Users can also add expenses manually or 
upload their receipts or make any changes on the entries added previously. 
2.Classify Expenditures: The system will classify expenditures into a number of 
heads e.g. food, travel, shopping which will help the users in tracking their 
expenses further.  
3.Generate Monthly Statements: They will be able to prepare reports on their  
monthly expenditures increasing the ability to view their overall and segmented 
expenses.
